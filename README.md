# Kinito.RaspberryPi
Kinito RaspberryPi Description

## Initial setup

1. Expand Filesystem: no need to do this â€” some may disagree on this point
2. Change User Password: recommended to change this, as using the default password can cause security concerns

3. Enable Boot to Desktop/Scratch: by default, this is set to console, which is what we want to keep

4. Internationalisation Options: set your timezone (if in the US, choose America, then find the correct city with your timezone)
5. Enable Camera: no (you can always change this later)
6. Add to Rastrack: no
7. Overclock: this is up to you, I usually choose Medium, which makes the Pi run a little bit faster at the expense of power and potential component damange
8. Advanced options: choose A4 SSH -- this will enable secure shell access, which means that you can control your Raspberry Pi from a remote computer (extremely useful)
